# TinyTapeout project information
project:
  wokwi_id:    369618011219206145        # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID

# If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. 
# Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately
#  source_files:        
#    - counter.v
#    - decoder.v
#  top_module:  "tt_um_example"      # Put the name of your top module here, must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username

# How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"    # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 4x2 or 8x2

# Keep a track of the submission yaml
yaml_version: 4

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it. This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.
#
# Here is a great example: https://github.com/davidsiaw/tt02-davidsiaw-stackcalc/blob/38c5647f83aad2aec675d566aa3d67b98f0aac81/info.yaml

  author:       "Adan Torralba"      # Your name
  title:        "4 Bit SerDes"      # Project title
  language:     "Wokwi" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  description:  "Serializes and Deserializes a 4 bit word"      # Short description of what your project does

# Longer description of how the project works. You can use standard markdown format.
  how_it_works: |
      Serializer: input a 4 bit word [A,B,C,D], the output is a serial version of the parallel word "ABCD..."
      Deserializer: input a serialized 4 bit word "ABCD...", the output is a 4bit bus with the word [A,B,C,D]

# Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  how_to_test:  |
      Input a known 4bit word in Tx_in[0:3], lets say [A,B,C,D], connect Tx_out to Rx_in, read the output  Rx_out0[0:3].
      Rx_out0[0:3] should be the same than Tx_in[0:3]: Possible bit orders are: [A,B,C,D] or [C,D,A,B]
